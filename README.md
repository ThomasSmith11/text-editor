A simple text editor with limited functionality to learn to write in C++

Tested only on a 2013 Macbook Pro running Linux Mint 21.1 Cinnamon.

Has functionality for editing and saving files, as well as searching.

If you wish to try it out, clone the repository, cd into the cloned repo, and run make.  Then run ./TextEditor path/to/file/you/wish/to/edit
