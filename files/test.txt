This is a test txt file to evaluate functionality of the text editor.

One of the major current limitations noted is line length, as I have not yet
implemented text wrapping.

Other than that limitation, however, the editor isn't bad to use.

It likely isn't the most efficient, as I chose to re-render the entire doc
upon almost every keystroke, but this was made to learn C++, not write
a sophisticated editor.

Saving functionality?: check

Finding func?: mostly check, occasionally finds something that shouldn't match

These lines are here to evaluate files longer than the displayed area:

That functionality appears to be working correctly
